* Hawaiian Religion

** A religious story
   Hawaiian creation myth/story begins with darkness and it attempts
to explain how every being came into existence in relation to
darkness. The creatures that live in the dark were the first and as
they gave birth to more creatures the darkness faded away, starting
from total darkness(Kumulipo and Po’ele created bottom dwellers of the
ocean and plants that grow in dark). They gave birth to deep darkness(Pouliuli)
and darkness with little light(Powehiwehi). These two created
fish and other land creatures that live in almost darkness. These dark
creatures had offspring and with every new life, the deep darkness of
the world got a little brighter. The second couple gave birth to a
third: the male Po’el’ele, whose name means “night” and the female Pohaha,
whose name means “coming into dawn”. These two created the creatures
of the darkness-near-dawn; the insects that fly by night, the
caterpillar, the grasshopper and a large egg. The egg hatched into
thousands of birds. These were the birds that fly and sing in the
hours just before dawn. 

   Hawaiian creation story continues this way until it reaches the
   first man Ki'i and first woman La'ila'a. They were both dark since
   they were born just at dawn. The first man and first woman had many
   children. With each generation, their skins became lighter and
   lighter until they became the color they are now. After the birth
   of Laʻilaʻi, the woman, and Kiʻi, the man, the man succeeds at
   seducing and reproducing with the woman before the god Kāne has a
   chance, thereby making the divine lineage of the gods younger than
   and thus subservient to the lineage of man. This, in turn,
   illustrates the transition of mankind from being symbols for the
   gods (the literal meaning of kiʻi) into the keeper of these symbols
   in the form of idols and the like.

** Non empirical being, powers, states or place
   Hawaiians had a place of worship called Heiau. Although this is not
   the only place where they had to worship. Offerings, sacrifices,
   and prayers were offered at these temples, ko'a(shrines), wahi
   pana(sacred places) and at small kuahu(altars) in individual homes.

** Ritual
   Rituals differed from Western culture and in some ways unique.
Hawaiian prayers and worship acknowledged that man also has
mana(respect), so they did not prostrate before their gods. Hawaiian
prayers and worship believed respect and self-respect. They prayed
sitting upright, head high and eyes open.

** Symbol
   Hawaiian religion has many symbols. Symbols were used to worship
   nature, illustrate creation stories and wartime stories. In this
   picture, we see the god
   of war - Kū

** Specialized roles
   Hawaiian history recognizes a group of people as Kahuna, who are
   educated individuals who often occupied higher positions in the
   social hierarchy offering healing, working in temples, served the
   king etc., Although, they occupied high social status, Hawaiians
   didn't believe they had mythical transcendence from God. Kahuna
   were also brought to talk to the spirits. 

** Altered state of consciousness
   - Hawaiian religion didn't believe in transition to altered states of
     consciousness. They did believe in spiritual possession(akua
     noho). But this was an act of the spirit and not of the man.
     Kahuna people were brought to talk to spirits. It was not an
     ecstatic experience but simply a communion with the known spirits.

** Change over time
   Traditional Hawaiian religion was one of family and oneness with all
   things. The people were in tune with nature, plants, trees,
   animals, the ‘āina, and each other. They respected
   all things and took care of all things. All was
   pono(righteousness). In the dominant current of Western thought
   there is a fundamental separation between humanity and divinity.
   Influx of missionaries and immigrants introduced a lot of taboos
   and outlawed traditional hawaiian religion. A number of traditions
   typically associated with it survived by integration, practicing in
   hiding, or practicing in rural communities in the islands.
   Traditions that appealed to western tourists were allowed to be
   practiced in public - for example: Hula
