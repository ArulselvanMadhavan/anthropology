In your post, first describe what they would imagine heaven to be
like, and then describe how they would explain the persistence of the
belief in heaven. Minimum of 4 sentences.

An anthropologist with an evolutionary perspective would imagine to
heaven to be an outcome of the things human minds can conceive and
associate with happiness but can't achieve it yet. An evolutionary
perspective would theorize that heavens would also evolve with human
minds. A heaven which consisted of cherubic angels in the past could
consist moviestars that people have come to like or a food item that
they like(say Noodles) or a person they never had a chance to confess their love.
Conception of Heaven is a natural outcome of what people want in their
life, feel happiness towards, things they missed out in their current
life, things they regret. The existence of a space where we can
achieve all our dreams fulfills the part of our brain that looks for
hope and drive to work towards a purpose, which could explain its persistence
