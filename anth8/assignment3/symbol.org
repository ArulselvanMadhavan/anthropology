* Symbol
** Instructions
   1. Choose an idea or a word that really resonates with you.
   2. Make it something simple enough for you to be able to easily
      represent it. Say, truth or happiness or bliss or peace or joy,
      anything like that (and it doesn't have to be positive, just
      meaningful to you). Write this word or meaning as a caption on
      the image.
   3. Think about what symbols you might create to represent this, and
      draw it, or take a picture of it (if it already exists). No
      artistic talent required, but drawings are preferred. After all,
      when was the last time you got an excuse to draw/doodle
      something for credit?
   4. Upload a photo of the image you drew/found. For help uploading
      an image, click here (Links to an external site)
   5. Explain your symbol, why it is significant to you, and what it
      means in a minimum of 4 sentences. 
** My hope for a society

   I came across this image on May Day and it stuck with me since then.
   This art was created by Walter Crane to commemorate the historical
   Haymarket Affair in Chicago. The image represents collective power,
   selflessness and the simple things we can do for each other. I like
   to imagine that the scene depicted in this image is a casual
   occurance in a society that I want to be a part of. It's not an
   event that warrants attention. People walk by, this woman,
   painting, silently. The woman is pre-occupied with her artwork and
   when she is done, she quietly gathers her belonging and gets on
   with her day. This was just something that she felt like doing on
   her way to school where she teaches kids. Not a word was spoken
   between the woman and the dozens of people who walked by. But
   everyone who walked by this lady painting, felt proud of being in a
   society that stands up for one another. They have their spirits
   lifted knowing that they everything they do matters. It *matters to
   someone*. They may not get to see it. But they *know* that it does.
   My hope is that I get to create/experience the feeling of living in a
   society this image made me envision.
